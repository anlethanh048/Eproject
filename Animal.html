                                <h2>Moose</h2>
                                <h5>Scientific name:<small>A mature male moose is called a bull, a mature female a
                                        cow, and an immature moose of either sex a calf.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Habitat:<small>Moose require habitat with adequate edible plants (e.g., pond
                                        grasses, young trees and shrubs), cover from predators, and protection from
                                        extremely hot or cold weather. Moose travel among different habitats with
                                        the seasons to address these requirements. Moose avoid areas with little or
                                        no snow as this increases the risk of predation by wolves and avoid areas
                                        with deep snow, as this impairs mobility. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Decline in population:
                                    <small>Since the 1990s, moose populations have declined dramatically in much of
                                        temperate North America, although they remain stable in arctic and subarctic
                                        regions.The moose population in New Hampshire fell from 7,500 in the early
                                        2000s to a current estimate of 4,000 and in Vermont the numbers were down to
                                        2,200 from a high of 5,000 animals in 2005. Much of the decline has been
                                        attributed to the winter tick with about 70% of the moose calf deaths across
                                        Maine and New Hampshire due to the parasite.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Size and weight:<small>On average, an adult moose stands 1.4–2.1 m (4.6–6.9 ft)
                                        high at the shoulder, which is more than a foot higher than the next largest
                                        deer on average, the wapiti. Males (or "bulls") normally weigh from 380 to
                                        700 kg (838 to 1,543 lb) and females (or "cows") typically weigh 200 to 490
                                        kg (441 to 1,080 lb), depending on racial or clinal as well as individual
                                        age or nutritional variations.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Dewlap:<small>Both male and female moose have a dewlap or bell, which is a fold
                                        of skin under the chin. Its exact use is unknown, but theories state that it
                                        might be used in mating, as a visual and olfactory signal, or as a dominance
                                        signal by males, as are the antlers</small></h5>
                                <h5>Fur:<small>Their fur consist of two layers; top layer of long guard hairs and a
                                        soft wooly undercoat. The guard hairs are hollow and filled with air for
                                        better insulation, which also helps them stay afloat when swimming.

                                    </small></h5>

                                <h2>Lion</h2>
                                <h5>Scientific name:<small>Felis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus
                                        in 1758, who described the lion in his work Systema Naturae. The genus name
                                        Panthera was coined by German naturalist Lorenz Oken in 1816</small></h5>
                                <h5>Subspecies:<small>In the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens
                                        were described and proposed as subspecies, with about a dozen recognised as
                                        valid taxa until 2017. Lion samples from some parts of the Ethiopian
                                        Highlands cluster genetically with those from Cameroon and Chad, while lions
                                        from other areas of Ethiopia cluster with samples from East Africa.</small>
                                </h5>
                                <h5>Evolution:<small>The lion's closest relatives are the other species of the genus
                                        Panthera, namely tiger, snow leopard, jaguar, and leopard. Results of
                                        phylogenetic studies published in 2006 and 2009 indicate that the jaguar and
                                        the lion belong to one sister group that diverged about 2.06 million years
                                        ago. The modern lion was probably widely distributed in Africa during the
                                        Middle Pleistocene and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa during the
                                        Late Pleistocene. Lion populations in East and Southern Africa became
                                        separated from populations in West and North Africa when the equatorial
                                        rainforest expanded 183,500–81,800 years ago.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Hybrids:<small>In zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids for
                                        the curiosity of visitors or for scientific purpose. The liger is bigger
                                        than a lion and a tiger, whereas most tigons are relatively small compared
                                        to their parents because of reciprocal gene effects.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Distribution and habitat:<small>African lions live in scattered populations
                                        across Sub-Saharan Africa.The lion prefers grassy plains and savannahs,
                                        scrub bordering rivers and open woodlands with bushes. It is absent from
                                        rainforest and rarely enters closed forest. On Mount Elgon, the lion has
                                        been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and close to the
                                        snow line on Mount Kenya. Lions occur in savannah grasslands with scattered
                                        acacia trees, which serve as shade. The Asiatic lion now only survives in
                                        and around Gir National Park in Gujarat, western India. Its habitat is a
                                        mixture of dry savannah forest and very dry, deciduous scrub forest.</small>

                                <h5>Profile:<small>The wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the gray/grey wolf, is a
                                        canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North
                                        America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging
                                        40 kg (88 lb) and females 35.5–37.7 kg (78–83 lb). It is distinguished from
                                        other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features,
                                        particularly on the ears and muzzle. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Evolution:<small>The earliest fossils of Canis lupus were found in what was once
                                        eastern Beringia at Old Crow, Yukon, Canada and at Cripple Creek Sump,
                                        Fairbanks, Alaska. The age is not agreed upon but could date 1 million
                                        YBP.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Distribution and habitat:<small>Originally, wolves occurred across Eurasia above
                                        the 12th parallel north and across North America above the 15th parallel
                                        north. However, deliberate human persecution has reduced the wolf's range to
                                        about one-third of what it once was because of livestock predation and fear
                                        of attacks on humans.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Dentition and bite force:<small>The wolf's head is large and heavy, with a wide
                                        forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt muzzle. The skull averages 230–280
                                        mm (9.1–11.0 in) in length and 130–150 mm (5.1–5.9 in) in width</small></h5>

                                        short tons) and females standing 247–273 cm (8 ft 1 in–8 ft 11 in) tall at
                                        the shoulder with a body mass of 2.6–3.5 t (2.9–3.9 short tons). </small>
                                </h5>
                                <h5>Ecology and activities:<small>Asian elephants prefer areas with a mix of
                                        grasses, low woody plants, and trees, primarily inhabiting dry thorn-scrub
                                        forests in southern India and Sri Lanka and evergreen forests in Malaya.
                                        Because of their large size, elephants have a huge impact on their
                                        environments and are considered keystone species. Their habit of uprooting
                                        trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig
                                        for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other
                                        animals.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Communication:<small>Touching is an important form of communication among
                                        elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their
                                        trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use
                                        trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of
                                        any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and
                                        genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows
                                        individuals to pick up chemical cues. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Habitat destruction:<small>African elephants are listed as vulnerable and Asian
                                        elephants as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of
                                        Nature (IUCN). One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the
                                        ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats
                                        to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local
                                        people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. </small></h5>

                                <h5>Gorilla Facts:<small> Gorillas are the world's largest primates. Both species of
                                        the gorilla, the eastern and western gorilla, are critically endangered. The
                                        DNA of gorillas has a 95-99% match to that of humans.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Physical Description:<small>Average wild males weigh between 300 and 430 pounds
                                        while females weigh half as much. Adult males have a height ranging from 4
                                        feet 11 inches to 5 feet 11 inches and arm span between 7 feet 7 inches and
                                        8 feet 6 inches. Females are smaller in all aspects. In captivity, gorillas
                                        are capable of growing to even bigger sizes. The eastern gorilla is darker
                                        than the western gorilla, but the mountain gorilla is the darkest and has
                                        the thickest fur.

                                    </small></h5>
                                <h5>Behavior:<small>Gorillas are highly sociable animals that live in groups of 5 to
                                        30 gorillas with an adult male or silverback as the leader. A silverback is
                                        an old gorilla above 12 years old. At that age, they develop a patch of
                                        silver on the back. The leader makes all the decisions such as conflict
                                        mediation and determining movement, among other decisions. Younger males,
                                        also called blackbacks, serve as additional protection. Bonds exist between
                                        males and females for a mutually beneficial relationship of mating and
                                        protection. Male to male bonds are weaker.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Habitat and Range:<small>The range of both species of gorillas is divided by the
                                        Congo River and the tributary rivers. The western gorilla lives in West
                                        Africa while in eastern and central Africa the eastern gorilla resides. The
                                        population is distributed among plenty of habitats. Gorillas’ habitats are
                                        diverse and range from swamps to montane forests with heights ranging from
                                        2,130 feet and 13,120 feet above the sea level for the case of eastern
                                        mountain gorillas. The habitats for the eastern lowland gorillas may be
                                        montane bamboo forests or lowland forests with heights between 1,969 and
                                        10,853 feet..
                                    </small></h5>
                                <h5>Reproduction:<small>Females mature when they are around 10 years old while males
                                        mature at around 11 years. The infants are dependent on the mother until
                                        they are around six years where they are weaned and the mother and the
                                        infant sleep in different places. The mother then begins to ovulate again.
                                        The males play no active role in the upbringing.

                                <h5>Behavior:<small>A giraffe is a non-territorial and very socially-oriented
                                        animal. The female adults bond in groups of 10 to 12 without a male, not
                                        counting their suckling young, and male giraffes stay in their herds. When

                                <h5>Profile:<small>Biological taxonomists believe that they are closely related to
                                        whales, dolphins, and pigs. Hippos measure 12 to 15 feet in length, are 5
                                        feet tall at the shoulder, and often weigh as much as 3.5 tons.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Habitat and Range:<small>Hippopotamuses live in slow-moving rivers and lakes
                                        surrounded by grasslands. One can find them in the Southern and Central
                                        Africa, near the Nile River, and south of the Sahara Desert. The common
                                        hippopotamuses are not classified as endangered species, but instead a
                                        “vulnerable” one, with approximately 125,000 to 148,000 of them remaining in
                                        the world.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Behavior:<small>Hippos spend most of the hours during the day immersed in
                                        slow-moving waters in order to cope with the hot conditions of the African
                                        savanna. They live in groups, called “bloats”, of about 15 to 30
                                        individuals, with the strongest male (or “bull”) dominating each

                                <h5>Reproduction:<small>The dominant male in each bloat is the only one responsible
                                        for mating with the females. In case one of the other males tries to mate
                                        with one of the females, the dominant bull will scare the intruder by
                                        producing a loud bellowing noise and opening its jaws wide.</small></h5>

                                <h5>Facts:<small>Platypus is a semiaquatic mammal that lay eggs. The common
                                        residence for this animal include the lakes and streams of eastern
                                        Australia. They can also be found in Tasmania. They are the one of the few
                                        mammals that reproduce by lay eggs, known as monotremes. Another name for
                                        platypus is the duck-billed platypus. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Physical Description:<small>The female platypus is smaller than the male
                                        platypus; the males can measure up to 60 cm long from the tip of the bill to
                                        the tip of the tail. Typically, females are 370 to 550 millimeters, and
                                        males are 400 to 630 millimeters long. The weight for females ranges from
                                        600 to 1,700 grams, while the males weigh about 800 to 3,000 grams.</small>
                                </h5>
                                <h5>Behavior:<small>Platypuses navigate with the tails and hind feet and swim with
                                        the front feet. Platypuses can move swim very well in the water as compared
                                        to when they are moving across the land. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Habitat and Range:<small>These animals are found only in a small part of the
                                        world. Freshwater areas that run into and out the eastern and southern coast
                                        of Australia and island of Tasmania are homes to the platypuses. </small>
                                </h5>
                                <h5>Reproduction:<small>The female platypus excavates down inside the ground on the
                                        waterside and covers herself into one of her tunnel rooms when it is time to
                                        breed. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Diet:<small>Platypuses are carnivorous; their food include insects and shellfish
                                        in water. Their sensitized bills help them discover food in the muddy bottom
                                        of the water as they swim. </small></h5>

                                        has one horn.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Physical Description:<small>The Indian rhinoceros, unlike other rhino species,
                                        has only one horn, hence its scientific name Rhinoceros unicornis, which
                                        means "horned nose and one-horned". Its grey-brown hide has folds on the
                                        neck, shoulder, and rump. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Habitat and Range:<small>Small parts of India and Nepal are where populations of
                                        the Indian rhinocerous are to be found today, though in the past they were
                                        also seen living in Bhutan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. These countries have
                                        tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, shrublands, forests, and
                                        swamps, of all which may be inhabited by Indian rhino.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Behavior:<small>The Indian rhinoceros is a solitary animal, except for when
                                        mating or when females are caring for their calves. Still, there are
                                        amorphous clusters formed near watering spots, such as swamps, and in their
                                        feeding ranges. The Indian rhinoceros loves to swim, and will wallow in mud
                                        and water to keep insects from biting its sensitive skin, as well as to
                                        lessen the irritation when it is bitten.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Reproduction:<small>A male Indian rhinocerous reaches sexual maturity between 9
                                        and 10 years of age, while a female becomes ready to mate at 4 to 7 years of
                                        age. Breeding for Indian rhinos occurs all year round. For a male Indian
                                        rhinocerous to mate with a female, it battles other males with its tusk-like
                                        incisors, until one has totally dominated the other to claim
                                        victory.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Diet:<small>The Indian rhinocerous is herbivorous, and primarily a grazer. It
                                        grazes in the early morning or in the evening, and its diet is largely made
                                        up by grasses, such as Saccharum, though it also eats leaves, branches,
                                        cultivated crops, shrubs, fruits and aquatic plants, according to WWF.

                                <h5>Porcuppine Facts:<small>Porcupines belong in the order Rodentia and are easily
                                        identifiable by their quill-covered bodies. The small mammals are grouped
                                        into two families, Erethizontidae (new world porcupines) and Hystricidae
                                        (old world porcupines). </small></h5>

                                        porcupines varies significantly. New world porcupines are stout, small, and
                                        have relatively shorter quills on the back which are interspersed with long
                                        soft hairs. They have a body length of about 12 inches with some larger
                                        porcupines reaching 34 inches</small></h5>
                                <h5>Habitat and Range:<small>Old world porcupines are found in southern Europe, most
                                        parts of Africa, and western and southern Asia. New world porcupines are
                                        found in South and North America, particularly in wooded and forested areas.
                                        Porcupines are adapted to a variety of habitats including tropical and
                                        temperate regions. They can occupy forests, grasslands, deserts, rocky
                                        outcrops, and rock crevices.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Behavior:<small>Porcupines are mostly nocturnal and move in either small groups
                                        or in solitary. Despite their poor sight, porcupines have a highly developed
                                        sense of smell and hearing. They freeze when approached by predators and
                                        sometimes show aggressive behavior such as running backwards or sideways
                                        towards the attacker to implant their spikes. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Living:<small>They can occupy forests, grasslands, deserts, rocky outcrops, and

                                <h5>Camels Facts:<small>Camels are domestic animals that have hoofs founds in Asia
                                        and Africa. They often live in desert or semi-desert regions. Nomads keep
                                        camels for their milk and meat which they consume to survive. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Biology:<small>The average life expectancy of a camel is 40 to 50 years. A
                                        full-grown adult camel stands 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) at the shoulder and 2.15 m
                                        (7 ft 1 in) at the hump. Camels can run at up to 65 km/h (40 mph) in short
                                        bursts and sustain speeds of up to 40 km/h (25 mph)</small></h5>
                                <h5>Evolution:<small>The earliest known camel, called Protylopus, lived in North
                                        America 40 to 50 million years ago (during the Eocene). It was about the
                                        size of a rabbit and lived in the open woodlands of what is now South
                                        Dakota</small></h5>
                                <h5>Domestication:<small>Like horses before their extinction in their continent of
                                        origin, camels spread across the Bering land bridge, moving in the opposite
                                        direction from the Asian immigration to America. They survived in the Old
                                        World, and eventually humans domesticated them and spread them globally.
                                        Along with many other megafauna in North America, the original wild camels
                                        were wiped out during the spread of Native Americans from Asia into North
                                        America, 12,000 to 10,000 years ago</small></h5>
                                <h5>Textiles:<small>?Desert tribes and Mongolian nomads use camel hair for tents,
                                        yurts, clothing, bedding and accessories. Camels have outer guard hairs and
                                        soft inner down, and the fibers are sorted by color and age of the animal.
                                        The guard hairs can be felted for use as waterproof coats for the herdsmen,
                                        while the softer hair is used for premium goods. The fiber can be spun for
                                        use in weaving or made into yarns for hand knitting or crochet.</small></h5>

                                        90% being dromedaries.Dromedaries alive today are domesticated animals
                                        (mostly living in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, Maghreb, Middle East and
                                        South Asia). The Horn region alone has the largest concentration of camels

                                <h2>Rattlesnake</h2>
                                <h5>Rattlesnake Facts:<small>Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the
                                        genera Crotalus and Sistrurus[1] of the subfamily Crotalinae (the pit
                                        vipers). The scientific name Crotalus is derived from the Greek κρόταλον,
                                        meaning "castanet". Rattlesnakes receive their name from the rattle located
                                        at the end of their tails, which makes a loud rattling noise when vibrated
                                        that deters predators or serves as a warning to passers-by. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Range and habitat:<small>Rattlesnakes are native to the Americas, living in
                                        diverse habitats from southwestern Canada to central Argentina. The large
                                        majority of species lives in the American Southwest and Mexico. Four species
                                        may be found east of the Mississippi River, and two in South America.
                                        Rattlesnakes are found in almost every type of habitat capable of supporting
                                        terrestrial ectothermic vertebrates, but individual species can have
                                        extremely specific habitat requirements, only able to live within certain
                                        plant associations in a narrow range of altitudes.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Hydration:<small>Rattlesnakes are believed to require at least their own body
                                        weight in water annually to remain hydrated. The method in which they drink
                                        depends on the water source. In larger bodies of water (streams, ponds,
                                        etc.), they submerge their heads and ingest water by opening and closing
                                        their jaws, which sucks in water. If drinking dew, or drinking from small
                                        puddles, they sip the liquid either by capillary action or by flattening and
                                        flooding their lower jaws</small></h5>
                                <h5>Living:<small>Rattlesnakes are predators that live in a wide array of habitats,
                                        hunting small animals such as birds and rodents.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Reproduction:<small>Most rattlesnake species mate during the summer or fall,
                                        while some species mate only in the spring, or during both the spring and
                                        fall.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Conservation status:<small>Rattlesnakes tend to avoid developed areas,
                                        preferring undisturbed, natural habitats. Rapid habitat destruction by
                                        humans, mass killings during events such as rattlesnake round-ups, and
                                        deliberate extermination campaigns all pose threats to rattlesnake
                                        populations in many areas. Several species of rattlesnakes, such as the
                                        timber rattlesnake, massasauga, and canebrake rattlesnake, are listed as
                                        threatened or endangered in many U.S. states.</small></h5>

                                        a movable quadrate bone, distinguishing them from the rhynchocephalians,
                                        which have more rigid diapsid skulls </small></h5>

                                        Dive into how the crocodile has evolved into an apex predator. Crocodiles
                                        are large social reptiles that live in Asia, Africa, Australia, and the
                                        Americas. A total of 40 species of crocodiles have been documented</small>
                                </h5>
                                <h5>Reproduction:<small>Crocodiles lay eggs in nests or holes. Nesting ranges from a
                                        few weeks to months. Courtship usually involves several displays of
                                        submissions and playfulness and may be protracted with mating happening in
                                        the water.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Biology:<small>The biology of crocodiles allows them to be top predators.
                                        Crocodiles possess like sharp senses with excellent night vision that gives
                                        them an edge over animals with poor night vision. The eyes are on top of the
                                        head allowing it to remain hidden from prey.</small></h5>

                                <h5>Diet:<small>Mostly they eat amphibians, crustaceans, reptiles, mammals, fish,
                                        and birds. The size of prey hunted largely depends on the size, age, and

                                <h2>Turtle</h2>
                                <h5>Scientific name:<small>Differences exist in usage of the common terms turtle,
                                        tortoise, and terrapin, depending on the variety of English being used.
                                        These terms are common names and do not reflect precise biological or
                                        taxonomic distinctions</small></h5>
                                <h5>Morphology:<small>The largest living chelonian is the leatherback sea turtle
                                        (Dermochelys coriacea), which reaches a shell length of 200 cm (6.6 ft) and
                                        can reach a weight of over 900 kg (2,000 lb). Freshwater turtles are
                                        generally smaller, but with the largest species, the Asian softshell turtle
                                        Pelochelys cantorii, a few individuals have been reported up to 200 cm (6.6
                                        ft). </small></h5>
                                <h5>Type of animal:<small>Turtle may either refer to the order as a whole, or to
                                        particular turtles that make up a form taxon that is not monophyletic, or
                                        may be limited to only aquatic species. Tortoise usually refers to any
                                        land-dwelling, non-swimming chelonian.[7] Terrapin is used to describe
                                        several species of small, edible, hard-shell turtles, typically those found
                                        in brackish waters.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Reproduction:<small>Turtles are known for displaying a wide variety of mating
                                        behaviors, however, they are not known for forming pair-bonds or for being
                                        part of a social group. Once fertilization has occurred and an offspring has
                                        been produced, neither parent will provide care for the offspring once it's
                                        hatched</small></h5>
                                <h5>Conservation Status:<small>In February 2011, the Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle
                                        Specialist Group published a report about the top 25 species of turtles most
                                        likely to become extinct, with a further 40 species at very high risk of
                                        becoming extinct. This list excludes sea turtles, however, both the
                                        leatherback and the Kemp's ridley would make the top 25 list.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Diet:<small>A turtle's diet varies greatly depending on the environment in which
                                        it lives. Adult turtles typically eat aquatic plants;[citation needed]
                                        invertebrates such as insects, snails, and worms; and have been reported to
                                        occasionally eat dead marine animals. Sea turtles typically feed on
                                        jellyfish, sponges, and other soft-bodied organisms.</small></h5>

                                <h5>Type of animal:<small>????????????????????????????????????</small></h5>
                                <h5>Feeding:<small>All four species are aquatic snakes that prey on other aquatic
                                        animals, including fish, river fowl, caiman, and capybaras. Some accounts
                                        exist of anacondas preying on domestic animals such as goats and sometime
                                        even Jaguar, that venture too close to the water.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Asexual reproduction:<small>Although sexual reproduction is by far the most
                                        common in Eunectes, E. murinus has been observed to undergo facultative
                                        parthenogenesis.[9][16] In both cases, the females had lived in isolation
                                        from other anacondas for over 8 years, and DNA analysis showed that the few
                                        fully formed offspring were genetically identical to the mothers; although
                                        this is not commonly observed,</small></h5>

                                <h5>Description:<small>The king cobra's skin is olive green with black and white bands
                                        on the trunk that converge to the head. The head is covered by 15 drab coloured
                                        and black edged shields. The muzzle is rounded, and the tongue black. It has two
                                        fangs and 3–5 maxillar teeth in the upper jaw, and two rows of teeth in the
                                        lower jaw. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Distribution and habitat:<small>The king cobra has a wide distribution in South and
                                        Southeast Asia. It occurs up to an elevation of 2,000 m (6,600 ft) from the
                                        Terai in India and southern Nepal to the Brahmaputra River basin in Bhutan and
                                        northeast India, Bangladesh and to Myanmar, southern China, Cambodia, Thailand,
                                        Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Behaviour and ecology:<small>Like other snakes, a king cobra receives chemical
                                        information via its forked tongue, which picks up scent particles and transfers
                                        them to a sensory receptor (Jacobson's organ) located in the roof of its mouth.
                                        When it detects the scent of prey, it flicks its tongue to gauge the prey's
                                        location, with the twin forks of the tongue acting in stereo. It senses
                                        earth-borne vibration and detects moving prey almost 100 m (330 ft)
                                        away.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Reproduction:<small>The female is gravid for 50 to 59 days.The king cobra is the
                                        only snake that builds a nest using dry leave litter, starting from late March
                                        to late May.[43] Most nests are located at the base of trees, are up to 55 cm
                                        (22 in) high in the center and 140 cm (55 in) wide at the base. They consist of
                                        several layers and have mostly one chamber, into which the female lays
                                        eggs.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Conservation Status:<small>The king cobra is listed in CITES Appendix II. It is
                                        protected in China and Vietnam.[1] In India, it is placed under Schedule II of
                                        Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Killing a king cobra is sentenced with
                                        imprisonment of up to six years</small></h5>
                                <h5>Diet:<small>The king cobra's diet consists primarily of other snakes and lizards,
                                        including Indian cobra, banded krait, rat snake, pythons, green whip snake,

                                        tails to steer through water. They are carnivores, and consume a wide range of
                                        prey. They are known to eat fish, frogs, rodents, birds, crabs, and snakes.
                                        Water monitors should be handled with care since they have many sharp teeth and
                                        can give gashing bites that can sever tendons and veins, causing extensive
                                        bleeding. </small></h5>

                                        elapid snake with dramatic coloration. The red-headed krait can grow to a length
                                        of up to 7 feet (2.1 m).The species presents a very striking and distinctive
                                        coloration – namely a bright red head and tail with a black body that includes a
                                        low-lateral narrow bluish white stripe</small></h5>
                                <h5>Distribution and habitat:<small>The red-headed krait occurs in Thailand, Myanmar
                                        (Burma), Cambodia, Vietnam, western Malaysia, Pulau Tioman, and Indonesia
                                        Red-headed kraits inhabit the rain forests in mountainous and hilly regions.
                                        They are hardly ever to be found in proximity to human habitations</small></h5>
                                <h5>Behaviour:<small>They are nocturnal and partially aquatic. Once thought to feed
                                        primarily on other snakes, they are known to include skinks, lizards, frogs,
                                        caecilians, small mammals, and snake eggs in their diets. </small></h5>
                                <h5>Venom:<small>The red-headed krait is an extremely venomous snake, although bites are
                                        reported rarely.[10] Krait venom appears to function primarily as a neurotoxin,
                                        preventing communication across neuromuscular synapses, causing paralysis and
                                        death by asphyxiation because the victims can no longer breathe on their
                                        own</small></h5>

                                        countries such as the UK have taken steps to halt their declines.Populations of

                                <h5>Behaviour:<small>Butterflies feed primarily on nectar from flowers. Some also derive

                                        dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators

                                <h5>General:<small>Green peafowl are large birds, amongst the largest living galliforms
                                        in terms of overall size, though rather lighter-bodied than the wild turkey, and
                                        perhaps the longest extant, wild bird in total length. The tail coverts are even
                                        longer than those of the male Indian peafowl, but are shorter than those of the
                                        arguses.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Length:<small>Male: 1.8 – 3 m (Large Adult, Including its tail covert), Female: 100
                                        – 110 cm (Large Adult)</small></h5>
                                <h5>Distribution:<small>The green peafowl was widely distributed in Southeast Asia in
                                        the past from eastern and north-eastern India, northern Myanmar, and southern
                                        China, extending through Laos, and Thailand into Vietnam, Cambodia, Peninsular
                                        Malaysia, and the islands of Java. Records from northeastern India have been
                                        questioned and old records are possibly of feral birds.The ranges have reduced
                                        with habitat destruction and hunting.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Habitat:<small>Green peafowl are found in a wide range of habitats, including
                                        primary and secondary forest, both tropical and subtropical, as well as
                                        evergreen and deciduous. They may also be found amongst bamboo, on grasslands,
                                        savannas, scrub, and farmland edge. In Vietnam, the preferred habitat was found
                                        to be dry, deciduous forest close to water and away from human disturbance.
                                        Proximity to water appears to be an important factor.</small></h5>

                                <h5>Status and conservation:<small>The first flamingo hatched in a European zoo was a
                                        Chilean flamingo at Zoo Basel in Switzerland in 1958. Since then, over 389
                                        flamingos have grown up in Basel and been distributed to other zoos around the

                                <h5>Lifespan:<small>Kakapo: 95 years, Hyacinth macaw: 50 years</small></h5>
                                <h5>Mass:<small>Kakapo: 2 – 4 kg, Hyacinth macaw: 1.2 – 1.7 kg, Buff-faced pygmy parrot:
                                        12 g</small></h5>
                                <h5>Distribution:<small>Psittaciformes, found in most tropical and subtropical regions.
                                        The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea ("true"
                                        parrots), the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand
                                        parrots). Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species
                                        inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well.</small></h5>
                                <h5>Behaviour:<small>Numerous challenges are found in studying wild parrots, as they are
                                        difficult to catch and once caught, they are difficult to mark. Most wild bird
                                        studies rely on banding or wing tagging, but parrots chew off such
                                        attachments</small></h5>
                                <h5>Diet:<small>The diet of parrots consists of seeds, fruit, nectar, pollen, buds, and
                                        sometimes arthropods and other animal prey.</small></h5>
